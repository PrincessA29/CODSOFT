       <p> 
        Hi! I am Princess Joeby Arabis, 19 years of age. I was born on January 29, 
        <br> 2004. I am from Balut Tondo, Manila. My former school was Timoteo Paez 
        <br> Integrated school with the strand of Technical Vocational specialization 
        <br> in Information Communication Technology, If I were to choose a song that
        <br> describes me, I believe it would be "A Million Dreams, 
        <br> for millions of dreams are keeping me awake and motivated not only for 
        <br> myself but also for my family. Multimedia Editing and Designing got my 
        <br> interest as well as Technology Field. I wanted to showcase my talents and skills 
        <br> at the same time learning and exploring these fields. I always look up to 
        <br> myself working in a reputable company and contributing to its growth while
        <br> I am enhancing my capabilities and unique skills. I'm aware that I'm young, but I 
        <br> have a clear vision of where I want to be in the future. Someday I want to be
        <br> a successful IT professional and a business owner.</p></div>

  <div class="desc">Me and My Mama
    <br> If there is one thing that I will be glad to have in my life, it is my mother. She was my first love 
<br> and the most beautiful and self-reliant woman I have ever known. She is my wonder woman because she is 
<br> the one who gave me life. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here right now. She loves me in spite of 
<br> my flaws, even though she is intimately familiar with me and my weaknesses. Even though I am too shy to
<br> tell her how I feel about her, I know in my heart that I cannot live my life without her because she is
<br> both my source of strength and my greatest treasure. I love her so very much. She is and always will be
<br> the person who motivates me, and the reason I work so hard right now is because I want to improve her life
<br> and make her proud of me.

  <div class="desc">MY FAMILY
    <br>
    <br>My mother and father are both on my left and right side, and the little girl on the right is my niece. 
<br> My family is not perfect like other people's families are, and we do not have a secure financial situation. 
<br> however, my parents are doing their best to provide for our needs and educational needs. Despite the fact that there are times when 
<br> we do not have enough money to meet our obligations, I am grateful and honored to have my family, and this is why I work so hard to 
<br> provide them with the kind of life they should have.

  <div class="desc"> MY FRIENDS
    <br>
    <br> These are my college friends, they help to stay out of my comfort zone because I am a quiet 
    <br> person and don't have social life because I was once traumatized because of bullying way back in 
    <br> junior high school, that's why I build high walls to everyone because I always think that they will judge 
    <br> and underestimate my capabilities, But these guys gave me hope that everything is not the same and there 
    <br> will be people who will accept me for who I am and what I have, I also have my strength and weaknesses like them and we help each other grow from that which will makes as better than before.</div>

  <div class="desc">I am now 19
    <br> Even though I'm 19, I still feel like a 15-year-old who doesn't know much about many things.
    I can't believe how fast time has gone by. I am currently in college, and people already expect
    a lot from me, especially now that I am a scholar in PLM and in the organization where my mother works.
    I hope that I will never get a grade that isn't at least satisfactory and that I will pass the course every semester.
    I am sure that the Lord God has plans not only for me but also for everyone else, that He will never leave my side and
   that He will always be there for me, even in the hardest times of my life, and that He will never give up on anyone. 
    I make a deal with myself that I will make my life and the lives of my parents better because I think they deserve to
   be happier and safer. As time goes on, my height will more than double. I will have a lot of success in the not-too-distant future.</div>
